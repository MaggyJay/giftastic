This was my first web app calling back an API. This app allows you to query the GIPHY API for GIF's. It was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and aJax. The purpose of the app is to create a mobile friendly application that calls gifs along with another API. This part is still in development, but as I brainstorm for other API's to implement with this app it will become more useful. 

A main problem I came across while creating this was having the GIF's be paused before clicking on them as well as pulling back new results each time you clicked a button.
